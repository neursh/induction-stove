Arduino based induction stove system with many features and highly customizable.

Why not. Imagine built yourself an induction stove, that's very cool and fun to do.

## What features?
- Inverter, saves money.
- Powerful mode, no saves money, but fast boil stuff.
- Persistent mode, keep the heat on, no saves money, but heater runs continuously.
- Timer stuff, timer in sequences.
- Detects overheat, likely burnt, and safe switch, can be paired with a smoke detector or anything you like to detect something is burning.
- Support all kinds of input system (if you can make it compatible).
- Can also be extended with a Wi-fi module to make it a smart induction stove, who's gonna stop you?
- Child lock, disable all inputs.
- Detect multiple invalid inputs and stop listening for inputs until normal again.
- Yada yada, if you don't like some features, just remove it, or adjust it, or add something else,... this is YOUR induction stove.

## That's a lot
I know, this is one of my thoughts when I'm about to sleep at 12.
